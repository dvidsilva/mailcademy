Introduction
=================

CONFIG.php has the variables that can be changed, like where the e-mail should be pointing the form to.

To use make a POST request to the notify.php file with a variable called message_url with a value that 
has the classid[name] / messages / the message_id.

for example: 'cs169/messages/19992', *IMPORTANT* with no trailing slashes (/)
